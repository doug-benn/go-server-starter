# Go Server Starter - ðŸš¨ Work in progress! ðŸš¨

Basic Server Template in Golang

## Description

Go Server Starter is a barebones, simple and easy to understand template, containing sensiable "boiler plate" for a backend.
Project Goals:
* Keep it simple stupid

*Disclamer:* Some of the feature have been added because I wanted to implyment them, they might not be the best choise for production golang backend. I have flagged them so that can be removed or disabled easily.


Current "Features":
* Middlewares "chain builder"
  - Access Logging
  - Panic Recovery

* Database connection
  -  Postgres connection pool



* Repository Pattern
* Postgres database connection
  * Test Container
* Logging - slog and zerolog (currently set up for zerolog - can be changed if the dependancy is a concern)
* Prometheus metrics exporting, Pyroscope Profiling

### Todo:
* Caching
* Documentation
* Json Encode and Decode
* SQLc
* Dockerfile & Docker Compose
* SQLite Support
* Websockets and SSE Event Broker
* Postgres Listener
